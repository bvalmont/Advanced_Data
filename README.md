The main file is climate_bv.ipynb
With the climate_bv.ipynb file open, run all the cells.  The flask section as tested will work from Jupyter notebooks and you will be able to call the specified api's as designed from the local host.  
The climate.py file can also be used to run Flask program if needed.  
The resources folder contains the sqlite file of the analyzed data along with the two original .csv files as a courtesy and as a reference.
